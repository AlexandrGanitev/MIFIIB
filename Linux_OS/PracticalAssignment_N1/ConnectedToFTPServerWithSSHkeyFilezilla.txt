Настроил FTP server, connected via terminal.
Затем попробовал PuTTY, но так и не нашёл PuTTYgen.
Установил FileZilla и используя ранее созданный SSH private key,
импортировал его, подключился к виртуальному Убунту серверу с MacOS.

On a Mac
If for some reason you are not using ssh-agent and on a Mac, don't worry about SSH key conversion. Just import your key via Settings and then use Normal mode in your site connection definition. The imported key will get used.

The following instructions assume you have a working SSH configuration which allows you to ssh to the same host without a password. They are adapted from a thread on superuser.com and are summarized here so you don't have to search through a lot of dead ends:

In FileZilla → Settings..., select Connection → SFTP
Press the Add key file... button
Press Command-Shift-G to bring up a path selection window and type "~/.ssh"
Select the "id_rsa" key file and click Open (this imports the key)
Click OK to close the Settings dialog
Open menu File → Site Manager...
Select the site with which you want to use the key
Choose Protocol "SFTP" and select Logon Type "Normal". Don't worry about a password if your key file doesn't have a password
Click Connect and you'll see your files
